Flint is still very early stage and experimental.
Not all features have been implemented.
:::

Flint is a fast, friendly linter for JavaScript, TypeScript, and other languages in the web ecosystem.
It is built as a _"hybrid linter"_, meaning:

- The core of Flint, as well as its lint rules, are written in TypeScript for approachability
- Language plugins may be written in native speed languages for performance

Flint's goal is to create a seamless linting experience that is both fast and user-friendly.
It is meant to include all the rules applicable to most web projects in its core, including JSON, Markdown, typed rules for JavaScript and TypeScript, and YAML.

:::tip
See [Introducing Flint](/blog/introducing-flint) for more information on hybrid linting and Flint's other experimental hypotheses.

## Getting Started

:::note
The `flint` setup experience is not yet implemented.
:::

Run `flint` in an existing project to set up a new configuration file.
It will prompt you for what areas of linting you'd like to enable, create a configuration file for you, and install any new dependencies.

<PackageManagers type="dlx" pkg="flint" />
