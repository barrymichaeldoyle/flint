<RuleSummary plugin="yaml" rule="blockSequences" />

Block style sequences use hyphens (`-`) to denote list items and are generally more readable for multi-item lists.
Flow style sequences use brackets (`[]`) and are more compact but less clear in most cases.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect">

```yml
items: [a, b, c]
```

```yml
nested:
  values: [1, 2, 3]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="✅ Correct">

```yml
items:
  - a
  - b
  - c
```

```yml
nested:
  values:
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Options

This rule is not configurable.
