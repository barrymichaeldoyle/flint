<RuleSummary plugin="ts" rule="objectKeyDuplicates" />

Duplicate object keys are legal in JavaScript, but they can lead to unexpected behavior.
When duplicate keys exist, only the last value for a given key is used.
This can cause confusion and bugs, especially when maintaining the code.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
const object = { a: 1, a: 2 };

const config = {
	port: 3000,
	host: "localhost",
	port: 8080,
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="✅ Correct">

```ts
const object = { a: 1, b: 2 };

const config = {
	host: "localhost",
	port: 8080,
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Options

This rule is not configurable.

## When Not To Use It

If your project intentionally creates duplicate keys as an unusual style choice, this rule may not be for you.
If you have a rare case where duplicate keys are intentional, you can use [Flint disable comments](/directives) for those specific situations instead of completely disabling this rule.
