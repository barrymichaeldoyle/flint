This glossary defines the common linting terms as used by Flint.

:::note
Other linters refer to some definitions using different terms.
See [Terminology Comparison](#terminology-comparison) for a table of equivalents.

## Linting Terms

### Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

A representation of the contents of a source file.
Lint rules and other forms of static analysis receive an AST to describe the code they analyze.

ASTs are "trees" in that each node, or area of file, may have child nodes.
For example, the CallExpression `console.log("Hello, world!")` has two children: a MemberExpression for `console.log` and a Literal for `"Hello, world!"`.

:::tip
The [typescript-eslint playground](https://typescript-eslint.io/play#showAST=ts&fileType=.tsx&code=MYewdgziA2CmB00QHMAUAiAEraSA0ABAO4gBO0AJgIToCUA3EA&eslintrc=N4KABGBEBOCuA2BTAzpAXGYBfEWg&tsconfig=N4KABGBEDGD2C2AHAlgGwKYCcDyiAuysAdgM6QBcYoEEkJemy0eAcgK6qoDCAFutAGsylBm3TgwAXxCSgA) provides a handy AST viewer for exploring the AST nodes generated for source code.

### Change

A modification to code, as suggested by the [linter](#linter) or a [rule](#rule).
Changes can either be:

- [Fixes](#fix): can be automatically applied, such as with a [`--fix`](/cli#--fix) command-line
- [Suggestions](#suggestion): may not be safe to apply, and are typically surfaced as editor suggestions or via [`--fix-suggestions`](/cli#--fix-suggestions)

### Comment Directive

An inline comment that changes how a [linter](#linter) should behave for a file.

Comment directives are most often used to disable some or all of a linter's rules.
For example, a directive might disable a particular rule for a specific file or block of code.

See the [Directives](/directives) documentation for details on using comment directives in Flint.

### Configuration

The set of options that control the behavior of a [linter](#linter).

Each project that adds a linter typically will include customizations in its configuration file specific to the project and its maintainers.
Those customizations are generally stored in a configuration file in the root of a repository.

### Fix

A [change](#change) that is safe to apply automatically.

Fixes are generally created by [rules](#rule) as a part of a [report](#report) when there is a single known best way to resolve a detected code defect.
Running a linter with [`--fix`](/cli#--fix) enabled will apply all reported fixes to code.

### Formatter

A tool that applies standard formatting to source code.

Common formatters include:

- [Biome's formatter](https://biomejs.dev/formatter)
- [dprint](http://dprint.dev)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io)

Formatters are generally very fast, as they only have to parse code and apply changes in a single pass.

### Linter

A tool that runs a set of [rules](#rule) on code in order to detect potential issues.

### Plugin

A standalone package that adds rules, presets, or other functionality for use with a linter.
Plugins are generally single-purpose: they often add rules for a one area of technology, such as a specific framework.

### Preset

A set of predefined [rules](#rule) and configuration options that may be used in a [configuration](#configuration).

### Presenter

Logic that takes in the results of linting and outputs it to the user.

:::note
This is typically called a _"formatter"_ by other linters, such as ESLint.
Flint refers to it as a _"presenter"_ to disambiguate from standalone [formatters](#formatter).
:::

### Processor

A hook that parses out additional information from files for linting.

Processors are most commonly used to extract nested files from existing source files.
For example, a Markdown processor might parse <code>```</code> code blocks from files and create corresponding virtual files to be linted.

### Report

A description of a potential issue in code.

Reports are generally created by [rules](#rule) when they detect a problem in a file.
They may also be created by the running [linter](#linter), such as when an invalid [comment directive](#comment-directive) is detected.

### Rule

A check for a specific pattern in code that may indicate a problem.

When a rule finds that problem in code, it will issue a [report](#report).

### Stylistic

An overloaded term generally used to describe lint rules that don't directly deal with logical bugs.
These rules are generally split into two categories:

- Formatting: rules that only change whitespace or other non-semantic aspects of code, such as indentation or line length
- Non-formatting: rules around consistency, such as naming conventions or whether to use one syntax over another equivalent one

Linters such as ESLint used to provide stylistic rules alongside logical ones.
Most linters now generally only include logical rules instead.
See:

- [ESLint: Changes to Rules Policies (May 2020)](https://eslint.org/blog/2020/05/changes-to-rules-policies)
- [ESLint: Deprecation of formatting rules (October 2023)](https://eslint.org/blog/2023/10/deprecating-formatting-rules)

#### ESLint Stylistic

[ESLint Stylistic](https://eslint.style) is an ESLint plugin that provides stylistic rules.
It mostly contains _formatting_ rules, as well as a small number of _non-formatting_ stylistic rules that are not eligible for inclusion in ESLint core.
See: [ESLint Stylistic > Why?](https://eslint.style/guide/why).

#### typescript-eslint Stylistic Config

The typescript-eslint project includes several preset configs under the label _"stylistic"_.
Those configs contain only _non-formatting_ stylistic rules that are recommended for most TypeScript projects.
See: [typescript-eslint > Shared Configs > `stylistic`](https://typescript-eslint.io/users/configs#stylistic).

### Suggestion

A [change](#change) that is not safe to apply automatically.

Suggestions are generally created by [rules](#rule) as a part of a [report](#report) when resolving the suggestion would change the meaning of code, and/or there are multiple potential changes that could be applied.
Users typically apply suggestions manually through an interface in their editor or via [`--fix-suggestions`](/cli#--fix-suggestions).

### Type-Aware Linting

The ability for [rules](#rule) to use information provided by a [type checker](#type-checker).

Type-aware linting allows rules to make more informed decisions about code.
For example, a lint rule that prevents looping over arrays with `for...in` statements can use type information to determine whether a variable is actually an array or some other type.

### Type Checker

A program that determines the possible types of values in source code, then makes sure the ways those values are used are consistent with their types.

The most common type checker in the web ecosystem is [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org).
TypeScript provides APIs that are used to inform [type-aware linting](#type-aware-linting).

## Terminology Comparison

Most concepts are referred to by the same terms by most linters.
However, some linters use different terms for other concepts.
This table shows how each linter refers to concepts whose terminology is not standardized.
